## 🧠 What’s Inside?

This "Human" has **three personalities**, each with its own impressive party trick:

### 1. 🧾 Wikipedia Auto-Stat Guy
- It opens Wikipedia, finds the page, and **fetches statistics** faster than your brain can even load the tab.
- Basically your nerdy best friend but in Python.

### 2. 🔐 HeroKu Login Wizard
- Opens [herokuapp.com](https://secure-retreat-92358.herokuapp.com/)
- Enters login details.
- Logs in all by itself.
- No hands, no eyes, no problem.

> Warning: May cause extreme laziness.

### 3. 🍪 Cookie Clicker on Steroids
- Visits [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/)
- Clicks the cookie like it has 1000 fingers on Red Bull
- Buys power-ups.
- Plays the **entire game** and wins in **minutes**.

> Disclaimer: Absolutely **not human behavior**. More like Cookie Terminator.
