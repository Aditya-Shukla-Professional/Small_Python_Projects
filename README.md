# 🐍 Python Projects – The Ultimate Playground

Welcome to the one-stop-shop for bite-sized Python brilliance 💻✨

This is a curated collection of small but mighty Python projects, each crafted while following **Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code: Python** course. These scripts are **short**, **sweet**, and sometimes **suspiciously smart**.

Whether you're here for fun, code, or just to make your computer click cookies like a maniac – you're in the right place.

## 📁 What’s Inside?

Here’s the buffet of brainchildren you'll find inside:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🐍 `SnakeGame` | The classic Nokia snake… but now with Pythonic hunger issues. |
| 🏓 `PongGame` | Pong, but coded by someone who definitely watched too much Tron. |
| 🔐 `PasswordManager` | Because forgetting passwords is human, but storing them safely is Python. |
| ⏲️ `PomodoroClock` | Your productivity sidekick. Tomato timer, meet terminal. |
| 🌎 `StateGuesser` | A geography nerd’s dream. Guess the U.S. states and see them pop on the map. |
| 👀 `HigherLower` | Pick who's more popular. A social media guessing game with high-stakes vibes. |
| 🧠 `Quizzer` | A quiz app that gives you questions, and silently judges your wrong answers. |
| 🚗 `TurtleCars` | You’ve seen fast cars. These are slow, drawable, adorable cars. |
| 🐢 `TurtleRace` | Place your bets! It’s turtle time, and anything can happen (very slowly). |
| 🤖 `Human` | A bot that opens websites, logs in, plays games, and clicks cookies like it’s on a mission from Skynet. |
