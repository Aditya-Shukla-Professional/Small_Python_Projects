# 🐍 The Legendary Snake Game

Ah yes, **Snake** — the OG time-killer from the indestructible Nokia brick phones. Reborn in Python because… nostalgia hits hard and boredom hits harder.

## 🎮 What is this?

It’s *that* game.  
You’re a snake. You eat stuff. You get longer. You crash into yourself. You die.  
Beautiful.

> Warning: This game has consumed more childhood hours than homework ever did.
