# 🗺️ USA State Guesser

Welcome to **USA State Guesser** — the game that tests your geography skills and exposes your inability to spell *Massachusetts*.

Think you know all 50 states?  
Let’s find out — *no Google allowed* (we’re watching 👀).

---

## 🎮 What’s the Game?

- A blank map of the USA appears.
- You type the name of a state.
- If you’re right, it shows up on the map.
- If you're wrong... nothing happens. Shame is enough punishment.

> Goal: Name all 50 states before your keyboard gives up on you.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

- 🗂️ CSV data with state coordinates
- 💡 Smart map updates as you guess
